# Headto

Tell your friends where you are heading.

----

Checking in after reaching a venue does not help anyone. How about checking in before hand so others can make it too?

How about spontaneous get-togethers? Meet people without having to plan.

_That's_ Headto.

----

What we wish to build:

A place where you can mark where you are heading and also share on Facebook and Twitter.
Indicate to others if you would like to also make it to where they are heading.
Leave small notes to help plan out where to meet.
Add suggestions on where to go next.
